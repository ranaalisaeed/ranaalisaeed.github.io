<div class="about-content">
  <h2>Hi, I'm Ali Rana.</h2>
  <p>I'm an engineer and by profession, a project management professional. I love improving processes and I have a passion for data analytics.</p>

  <p class='message'>
  A process could be anything, for example, a way to deliver projects, to find next investment property, and to take a process and make it more efficient. I'm driven by curiousity to understand how things really work - asking right questions, developing empathy and validating things with data.
  </p>

  <p>Empathy is the knowledge of users or knowing how they feel about something. Data is basically all the data that's relevant for the problem at hand e.g. to measure it or to find patterns.</p>

  <p>I conceptualize projects that provide most value to clients and deliver them in ways that have the highest or earliest chances of success.</p>

  <p>I have worked with clients in education, information technology and telco sectors delivering projects and programs using agile, waterfall or bespoke approaches.</p>

  <p>I'm particularly interested in working on data analytics, innovation for operational improvements and technology projects. Adopting a user-centric design thinking approach, I design, implement, test, and transition data driven projects.</p>

  <p>I aim to bridge gaps between design, tech, and the business, by working cross-functionally to research, prototype and deliver real products with effective, engaging, and accessible user experiences.</p>
