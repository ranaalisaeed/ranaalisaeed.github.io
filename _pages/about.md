Hi, I'm Ali Rana. 
I'm an engineer. I love improving processes and I specialise in data analytics.

<p class='message'>
The process could be anything - a way to deliver projects, way to find your home, to make processes more efficient. I curiously seek to understand how things really work, asking the right questions, with empathy and backed with data.

In my opinion, empathy is the knowledge of users or knowing how they feel about something. Data is basically all the data that's relevant for the problem at hand e.g. to measure it or to find patterns.

I can conceptualize projects that provide most value to my clients and deliver them in ways that have the highest or earliest chances of success.

I have worked with clients in Education, Information Technology and Telco sectors delivering projects and programs using agile, waterfall or bespoke approaches.

I'm particularly interested in working on data analytics, innovation for operational improvements and technology projects. Adopting a user-centric design thinking approach, I design, implement, test and transition data driven projects.

I aim to bridge gaps between design, tech, and the business, by working cross-functionally to research, prototype and deliver real products with effective, engaging, and accessible user experiences.
