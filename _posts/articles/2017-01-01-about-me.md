Rana is a Project Manager and technology solutions professional. He has delivered projects for clients in IT, telco and academia sectors for past thirteen years. 

These years have probably experienced the fastest wave of technological change. The explosion of digital data touched almost every industry and the demand of data speeds grew exponentially. 

Telcos evolved from 2G to 5G and smartphones became a commodity from once a luxury. 

Having ridden this wave of change, Rana has a passion for taking on new challenges. 

He is enthusiastic about Data Science (analytics, visualisation, presentation) and currently spends his leisure time as a student of machine learning and inferential statistics.
