   <title>The case of micro feedback in learning analytics dashboards</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked on many learning analytics dashboards for users in higher education, especially university teachers. A frequent challenge with dashboards is how to collect relevant feedback from users. This article proposed another way to collect timely feedback. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback is either quantitative or quantitative. Qualitative feedback is generally through user interviews and quantitative feedback through web traffic monitors, such as Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good feedback is essential to understand and improve data insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make the case here that qualitative feedback through user interviews is very limited. Interviews usually take places long after the actual experience. When interviewed, users tend to provide feedback reflecting (looking back) at an experience that isn’t fresh in minds. It’s usually long after the actual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dashboards have many charts and insights, and data is updated regularly, is there a better way to collect feedback that captures the essence of timeliness and usefulness of data, as it helps users in their day-to-day practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;micro-feedback&quot;&gt;Micro feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose a micro feedback collector, as a way to collect in-situ feedback against any chart. It’s strategically placed at the bottom of the chart container, so it doesn’t distract users from the content. It’s also conveniently located at the place of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/micro-feedback/micro-feedback_IMAGE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Micro feedback placed under a chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user finds a chart helpful, they can provide their feedback through a quick form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/micro-feedback/micro-feedback_YES.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Micro feedback journey for YES&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they don’t find a chart helpful, they can follow a similar journey. Notice how the question prompt adapts to ‘No’ input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/micro-feedback/micro-feedback_NO.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Micro feedback journey for NO&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User experience flow for micro feedback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;img-responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/micro-feedback/micro-feedback_FLOW.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Micro feedback flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-considerations&quot;&gt;Further considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we collect feedback his way, it is relevant to a specific chart for which the user provided the feedback. When there are several charts in the dashboard, what data model do we need at the back-end to collect scalable feedback? The date and time of such feedback might also be important to record in the back-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is related to ‘feedback fatigue’. Will users find it overwhelming to have these prompts available at so many places? Is there a more subtle way to do this? Users might need to be educated to ensure they understand this feedback is optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m interested to try this out with users and hear any thoughts from readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In designing the micro feedback form, I’ve taken inspiration from feedback forms provided at the end of Apple support articles. See an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202039&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>University teachers' view of useful learning analytics</title>
   <link href="/2020/06/11/what-teachers-want-from-learning-analytics/"/>
   <updated>2020-06-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>//2020/06/11/what-teachers-want-from-learning-analytics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several attempts at use of analytics to enhance teaching practices that were met with scepticism from academics. Retrospectives of those works were often challenged by “so what?” questions as academics couldn’t do much with insights from dashboards that lacked timeliness and context. This work explored what teachers really want from learning analytics to support their day-to-day teaching practice. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Analytics is defined as the “measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs”. Source of definition is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/&quot;&gt;SoLAR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many data science professionals, my first impressions of Learning Analytics were those flashy dashboards, laden with charts, crunching massive data and predicting outcomes from machine-learnt algorithms. I thought if I could build those, teachers will dwell right in. They’ll have the time to do all the sense-making. They’ll simply admire them. After making, or observing being made, a few such attempts, I can tell you nothing is farther from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that teachers are really busy people. Teaching hundreds, if not thousands, of students requires adhering to tight schedules with lots to do. We can’t simply expect them to get on the analytics band wagon, especially if doing so adds to their workload. So I set out on a mission to find out how, really, can we make Learning Analytics useful. This exercise revealed something really interesting that I hope to share in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start, teachers really want to see their students succeed. They work hard on all aspects of their unit so students achieve the best possible outcomes above relevant standards. If Learning Analytics was to gain traction with teachers, we need to rethink our approach. Whatever we provide to teachers should be very simple, timely and meaningful. We should trade difficult-to-understand charts for language that teachers readily understand. And most importantly, Learning Analytics should help reduce their workload, not increase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In several ideation and brainstorming workshops with teachers and academics from various desciplines, I explored the following prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
Based of our understanding of what students should be doing each teaching week, what would teachers want to know that helps them keep students engaged in their unit?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most responses I received fall in to the following seven groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About the cohort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synchronous engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assignment timeliness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reaching out to students at-risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion boards engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to see the type of questions asked in each group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-about-the-cohort&quot;&gt;1. About the cohort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing about the cohort early allows teachers to adjust their teaching activities to suit students’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, some students might be repeating the unit while some others might have special needs related to any disability. Learning Analytics can help by answering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Which students have special needs and what adjustments do I need to make?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Which students are repeating the unit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this one was very interesting: Teachers frequency experience students from different descriplines studying their unit as one class. Usually students from different courses need different level of teaching support. It would help teachers if Learning Analytics could answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is the descipline (course) profile and demographic mix of students in my unit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-content-engagement&quot;&gt;2. Content engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in the trimester, teachers expect students to read the unit outline. They should also access learning materials on the unit site.
Teachers would like to know early if students have to not engaged with unit site content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who has not accessed learning materials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-synchronous-engagement&quot;&gt;3. Synchronous engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronous engagement is about attending and engaging in classes (or seminars). Classes are essential part of learning where students get the opportunity to interact with their teachers and peers. Classes usually occur every week. If students don’t attend, they are likely to miss out on all that interaction. It might become hard for them to keep up. Teachers would like to know timely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who is not attending classes or watching recordings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-assignment-timeliness&quot;&gt;4. Assignment timeliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assignments make the important link betweeen student learning and achieving expected standards for a unit. Assignments are graded and students usually work through high-rigor and deadline pressures to achieve good marks. If students are missing submissions deadlines, this might be a sign that they’re struggling. Teachers would like to know from learning analytics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who did not submit assignment or submitted late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If students miss or delay multiple assignments, they might be at-risk of failing the unit. Teachers being able to know this early could mean they could reach out to students offering help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-reaching-out-to-students-at-risk&quot;&gt;5. Reaching out to students at-risk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While teachers expect learning analytics to indicate which students might be at-risk (as early as reliably possible), they’ve also often stressed that it’s very hard to get struggling students to speak up or reach out for help. Often by the time we know they are struggling, through Learning Analytics, they are already disengaged and little can be done to bring them back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who might need my help most and how might I help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Learning Analytics could do more to recommend the best known check-in strategies that work is different situations. For example some communication templates could be provided that make it easier for both teachers to reach out, saving their time, and for students to respond to those messages. This could be done with some proven (tried and tested) check-in templates available between the academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-discussion-boards-engagement&quot;&gt;6. Discussion boards engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students use discussion boards in their unit site to stay engaged, with the learning community, through dialog about course material. Discussion boards are also a good way helping students build their support networks. Moreover, not all engagement in discussions is graded, but some is. Teachers would like to know, through learning analytics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Who is not engaging in discussion forums? They might not necessarily reply or post, but are they atleast reading the forums?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-external-factors&quot;&gt;7. External factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University life could come with &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/beyond-ideas/stories/student-life/10-challenges-you-may-encounter-university&quot;&gt;many challenges and problems&lt;/a&gt;. Students juggling many competing priorities and usually navigate through a lot. If students are struggling in a unit, it might be because they’re under a lot of stress from other units or some other aspects of their university life. Teachers would like to know from learning analytics how their students are being supported in other areas of their university life so this context can help them build more personal relationships with the students base on empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are students being supported in their other units?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If someone is disengaged, are they struggling with other aspects of uni experience, such as outstanding tickets with university IT Help services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found these learnings very interesting, mainly because they weren’t about charts or tech., they were about what teacher care for ‘which of my students might need my help so they can be successful’. They was a pure reflection of what teachers stand for. Teachers spend so much time and energy towards making their students successful. Those in Learning Analytics domain should provide products that helpful, and underpinned by simplicy, making the job of teacher easier not harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-work&quot;&gt;Further work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful consideration needs to be given to student privacy and consent (how much data could we collect and for what purpose). There are also concerns related to Bias, such as Confirmation Bias, that should be addressed. When teachers know more about their students through Learning Analytics data, how do we ensure this additional knowledge does not negatively influence their objective judgement of student work. For example, a high achieving student in other units could be perceived as more competent than their peer student regardless of their quality of work in this unit.&lt;/p&gt;
