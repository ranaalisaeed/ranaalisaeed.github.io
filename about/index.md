Hi, 
Thank you for coming here to know me. 

In short, I am a business consultant and a machine learning enthusiast. I ‘MOOC’ a lot and usually complete the ones I like with super speed. Inspired by a friend, I bought my first bike (since childhood) and within a couple of months was riding to work every day (30km a day) and gadget tracking it like a pro. I live in Melbourne and a father of two gorgeous kids.

So that’s me in brief, but read on to know how I got here.

I grew up in a vibrant city of Pakistan called Lahore. With a keen interest in electronics and computers, I became an engineer and left home for higher ed. to the capital city of Islamabad. I signed up for a specialisation in Telecommunications and post-graduated with a gold medal (CGPA: 4/4). 

This academic record earned me an offer from my country towards a doctorate scholarship program - a highly prestigious program of the time offered only to a few each cohort. I did accept but later chose employment as circumstances created by 9/11 aftermath delayed my overseas paperwork. But you can say that I am very keen learner, I enjoy learning new knowledge and usually try to figure out easier ways to grasp difficult theoretical concepts that stay long in memory.

For over 13 years now, I have contributed in various management, techical and operational capacities to achieve positive outcomes for clients in IT, Telco and Academia sectors. I provide best-in-class project management, business analysis and solution architecture services to stakeholders. Geographically, I have been part of diverse corporate cultures from Australia, Middle East and Asian markets.

I’d love to get in touch with you.

Cheers
