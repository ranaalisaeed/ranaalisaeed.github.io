title: how to set up a simple workflow in Jira
---

Jira is an issue tracking tool by Atlassian for agile project management. It is highly flexible to suit team workflow in all shapes and size. However all this flexibility can be very confusing at times. You can configure it in so many ways. So what's the best way. 

The short answer is, it depends on whatever gets your team to use the tool. If you keep it too simplistic, for example by using the default workflow, you probably won't get much sufficient use and if you set it up as too details, everyone in the team doesn't use is consistently. 

Consider a simple software workflow:
